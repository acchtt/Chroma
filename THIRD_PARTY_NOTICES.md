# Third-party notices

Chroma uses Intel Graphics Control Library (IGCL) API materials, including the API header and wrapper implementation.

The official IGCL project is maintained by Intel at `intel/drivers.gpu.control-library`. Intel distributes the IGCL binaries with the Intel graphics driver; applications should use the installed driver library rather than packaging the IGCL runtime binary.

The IGCL API header is governed by Intel's Control API / IGCL license rather than the Chroma MIT License. Intel's license permits use and redistribution of the Control API software and IGCL header files solely for use on Intel platforms, subject to its stated conditions. Any redistributed Intel files must retain their Intel copyright and license notices.

Files derived from or copied from the Intel IGCL project must keep their original headers and applicable license terms. The Chroma MIT License applies only to Chroma-authored code and does not replace third-party licenses.
