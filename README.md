## Download

Download the validated Windows x64 build from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/acchtt/ArcVibrance/releases).

## Repository layout

- [`ArcVibrance.WinUI/`](ArcVibrance.WinUI/) — .NET 8 / WinUI 3 desktop interface
- [`NativeAgent/`](NativeAgent/) — native C++ monitoring and Intel color-control agent
- [`NativeAgent/tests/`](NativeAgent/tests/) — native profile-matching tests
- [`website/`](website/) — dependency-free GitHub Pages website
- [`.github/workflows/`](.github/workflows/) — automated Windows release builds

## Building from source

Recommended build environment:

- Visual Studio 2022
- Desktop development with C++ workload
- .NET 8 SDK
- Windows App SDK / WinUI 3 tooling
- CMake

From PowerShell:

```powershell
./build.ps1 -Configuration Release -Platform x64 -SelfContained
```

The build output is written to `dist/x64/`. The solution can also be opened directly from `ArcVibrance.sln`.

GitHub Actions runs the same Release x64 build and uploads a packaged Windows artifact for validation.
Release builds use the version in `ArcVibrance.WinUI.csproj`, publish a matching
versioned ZIP, and include a SHA-256 checksum beside the download. The portable
package contains only `ArcVibrance.exe` and `ArcVibrance.Agent.exe`; application
artwork is embedded in the UI executable.
